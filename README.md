In this game, you will find yourself in one of Chicago's Red Line subway stations, along with a gang of rats. Your player character (BB8) has the ability to shoot at and destroy each rat, allowing you to escape the station. A scoreboard in the upper right keeps track of the number of times you hit a rat. 

Scripts for player and camera movement, aiming, and weapon management were created by following Sebastion Grave's tutorials on Youtube.
